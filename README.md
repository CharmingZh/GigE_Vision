### Camera Introduction

#### Fusion Series FS-3200D-10GE

> [JAI's FS-3200D-10GE](https://www.jai.com/products/fs-3200d-10ge) is a 2-CMOS multispectral prism camera providing simultaneous images of different spectral bands in a single camera - a visible color channel from **400-670 nm** and a near infrared (NIR) channel from **740-1000 nm**. This makes it possible to simultaneously inspect surface properties and sub-surface defects. A backwards-compatible 10 GigE interface provides exceptional speed and networking flexibility.
